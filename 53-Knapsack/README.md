### Knapsack problem

    The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization.  We learned subset sum, which is also combination problem.  

    Given a universe U of n elements, a collection of subsets of U say S = {S1, S2â€¦,Sm} where every subset Si has an associated cost. Find a minimum cost subcollection of S that covers all elements of U.

### 0-1 Knapsack Problem

### Fractional Knapsack Problem

### Method to be used
    brute force
    greedy algorithm
    DP
    backtracking
    branch-and-bound
    divide and conquer

### Unbounded Knapsack (Knapsack with Repetitions)

    Unlike 0-1 knapsack problem, the repetition of items is allowed.
