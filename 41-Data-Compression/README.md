## Data Compression

    Data compression is a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data. Compressing data can save storage capacity, speed up file transfer, and decrease costs for storage hardware and network bandwidth.

    Data compression is often referred to as coding, where coding is a very general term encompassing any special representation of data which satisfies a given need. Information theory is defined to be the study of efficient coding and its consequences, in the form of speed of transmission and probability of error.

## Huffman coding  -- Variable length coding (vs. ASCII coding)

    1. Static Huffman coding
    2. Dynamic codes (or adaptive)
