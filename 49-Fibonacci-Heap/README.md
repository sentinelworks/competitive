## Fibonacci Heap
    Used in C++ STL priority queue

    Amortized time complexities of Fibonacci Heap.

    1) Find Min:      Θ(1)     [Same as both Binary and Binomial]
    2) Delete Min:    O(Log n) [Θ(Log n) in both Binary and Binomial]
    3) Insert:        Θ(1)     [Θ(Log n) in Binary and Θ(1) in Binomial]
    4) Decrease-Key:  Θ(1)     [Θ(Log n) in both Binary and Binomial]
    5) Merge:         Θ(1)     [Θ(m Log n) or Θ(m+n) in Binary and Θ(Log n) in Binomial]
