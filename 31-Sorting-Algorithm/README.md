We already learned heapsort based on binary heap data structure. (heapify for MaxHeap)

    quick sort: divide and conquer with pivotal, in-place, random iterator
    merge sort: 1938,  Von Neumann, divide and conquer, top-down/bottom-up implmentation
    bubble sort: sinking sort, only repeatedly comparing ajacent items
    insertion sort: 

Others:

    bucket sort
    bubble sort
    binary tree sort
    selection sort
    radix sort
