### Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) problem

    Definition: Let T be a rooted tree. The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as descendants

#### Linked list (vector) to store path from root

#### Single traversal (pre-order)

#### Using Parent Pointer

#### Using RMQ

#### Kth Ancestor in Binary Tree (not common but for one node)
