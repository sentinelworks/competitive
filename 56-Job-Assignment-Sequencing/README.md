### Job Sequencing With Deadline Problem (Greedy Algorithm)

    Problem:
    If job J=(J1,J2,J3,J4) are given their processing time Ti=(1,1,2,3) and deadline are Di=(3,4,2,3). Maximum how many jobs can be done? A)1 B)2 C)3 D)All

### Job Assignment Problem

    Let there be N workers and N jobs. Any worker can be assigned to perform any job, incurring some cost that may vary depending on the work-job assignment. It is required to perform all jobs by assigning exactly one worker to each job and exactly one job to each agent in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized.
