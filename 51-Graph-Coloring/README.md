### Graph coloring 
    The problem is to assign colors to certain elements of a graph subject to certain constraints.

#### Vertex coloring
    Given m colors, find a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are colored using same color.

#### Edge Coloring
    No vertex is incident to two edges of same color

#### Face Coloring (Geographical Map Coloring) 
    can be transformed into vertex coloring.

#### Chromatic Number
    The smallest number of colors needed to color a graph G is called its chromatic number.
